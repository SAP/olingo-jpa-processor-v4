    branches: [master] # A PR that targets these branches triggers a scan of the tip of that PR.
  # It is also recommended to schedule a scan for the case that CodeQL was updated and may discover new types of vulnerabilities.
  # You should schedule a weekly scan at a random time:
  schedule:
    #        ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
    #        │  ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
    #        │  │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
    #        │  │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
    #        │  │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)
    #        │  │ │ │ │
    #        │  │ │ │ │
    #        │  │ │ │ │
    #        *  * * * *
    - cron: '40 4 * * 1'
  # This allows you to trigger this workflow manually from GitHub:
