The JPA Processor shall fill the gap between Olingo V4 and the database if JPA is used for object-relational mapping.
At the current state the JPA Processor provide support for:  
1. Generating OData metadata from JPA metadata.  
2. Processing Get requests by converting them into Criteria Builder queries.  
3. Supporting entity manipulations.
